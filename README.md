🌱 Hi! I am busy imagining AI products & mobility services(CASE/MaaS) around autonomous vehicles of tomorrow, at Value Creation Division, Digital Transformation Supervisory Unit, <a href="https://www.hondarandd.jp/point.php?pid=1268&amp;lang=en">Honda R&amp;D Innovation Lab Akasaka</a><br>
🌱 My work often segues into business strategy, manufacturing/QC process optimisation, and marketing.


✨I graduated with a Bachelors &amp; Masters in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Industrial Engineering &amp; Operations Research from IIT Bombay, India in 2020.<br>
✨My master's thesis focussed on attention based multimodal fusion segmentation methods in computer vision and was advised by <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/sc">Subhasis Chaudhari</a> and <a href="https://biplab-banerjee.github.io">Biplab Banerjee</a>.<br>
✨Earlier, I researched on oscillator neural networks and also developed low-cost diagnostic devices, leading to a few publications, patents and awards.
