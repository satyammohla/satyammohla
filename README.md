🌱 Hi! I am busy imagining AI products & mobility services(CASE/MaaS) around autonomous vehicles of tomorrow, at Value Creation Division, Digital Transformation Supervisory Unit, <a href="https://www.hondarandd.jp/point.php?pid=1268&amp;lang=en">Honda Innovations Akasaka</a><br>
🌱 My work often segues into product strategy, new service design, manufacturing & QC optimisation.


✨I graduated with a Bachelors & Masters in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research from IIT Bombay, India.<br>
✨My master's thesis focussed on attention based multimodal fusion segmentation methods in computer vision and was advised by <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/sc">Subhasis Chaudhari</a> and <a href="https://biplab-banerjee.github.io">Biplab Banerjee</a>.<br>
✨In the past, I also developed low-cost diagnostic devices, leading to a few publications, patents and awards.

👀I have worked as a researcher at <a href="https://www.sony.co.jp/">Sony R&amp;D Tokyo</a>, <a href="https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/">AI IMPACT Lab</a>, <a href="https://anupamguha.com/"> AI Policy Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/sc">VIP Lab</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nanobioslab.com/">NanoBios Lab</a>.<br>
👀I also spent a few months at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg"> NTU</a> &amp; <a href="https://nbs.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/default.aspx"> NBS Singapore</a> as an undergraduate <a href="https://global.ntu.edu.sg/GMP/gemdiscoverer/Special%20Programmes/Pages/TFI--Learn.aspx">Temasek TfLEaRN Scholar</a>.</h4>

💞️ I am now interested in AI in Sustainability, AI for Mobility & Climate Justice, AI Policy & Ethics, AI for Social Good and Remote Sensing.<br>
